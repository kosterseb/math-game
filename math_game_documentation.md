## 1. Calculation Hierarchy (Order of Operations)

### 🧮 Theory
The calculation hierarchy determines the order in which mathematical operations are carried out.  
Commonly remembered as **PEMDAS/BODMAS**:  
- Parentheses / Brackets  
- Exponents / Orders  
- Multiplication & Division  
- Addition & Subtraction  

### ✅ Example
```
3 + 5 × 2^2 = ?
```
Step 1: Exponent → `2^2 = 4`  
Step 2: Multiplication → `5 × 4 = 20`  
Step 3: Addition → `3 + 20 = 23`  

### 🔎 Reflection
How does understanding calculation hierarchy improve problem-solving in your game?  
How can mistakes in hierarchy lead to errors in gameplay?

## 2. Equations

### 🧮 Theory
An equation is a mathematical statement asserting that two expressions are equal.  
General form:  
```
ax + b = c
```

### ✅ Example
```
2x + 3 = 11
```
Step 1: Subtract 3 → `2x = 8`  
Step 2: Divide by 2 → `x = 4`  

### 🔎 Reflection
How can solving equations be integrated into challenges in the game?  
What real-world applications can equations represent in gameplay?

## 3. Trigonometry

### 🧮 Theory
Trigonometry studies relationships between the angles and sides of triangles.  
Key functions:  
- Sine (sin) = Opposite / Hypotenuse  
- Cosine (cos) = Adjacent / Hypotenuse  
- Tangent (tan) = Opposite / Adjacent  

### ✅ Example
Right triangle with angle θ = 30° and hypotenuse = 10.  
```
sin(30°) = Opposite / 10 → Opposite = 10 × 0.5 = 5
```

### 🔎 Reflection
How can trigonometry be used in a game involving movement, angles, or aiming?  
Can trigonometric problems be turned into engaging challenges?

## 4. Coordinate Systems & Functions

### 🧮 Theory
A coordinate system allows points to be located in a plane using ordered pairs (x, y).  
Functions describe relationships between input (x) and output (y).  
- Linear: `y = mx + b`  
- Quadratic: `y = ax² + bx + c`  
- Other: Exponential, logarithmic, etc.  

### ✅ Example
```
y = 2x + 1
```
If `x = 3`, then `y = 2(3) + 1 = 7`.  

### 🔎 Reflection
How can coordinate systems represent maps, paths, or positioning in your game?  
Can different functions model difficulty curves, scoring, or player progression?
